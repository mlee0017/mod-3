This is a simple MERN stack app featuring user authentication with the use of bcrypt and jsonwebtoken, creating memos of current mood and description, reading, updating, and deleting memos. 

Technologies used:

- MongoDB: a database used to store collections of documents.
- Express.js: a backend application framework for Node.js used to handle HTTP requests.
- React: a JavaScript library used to develop the user interface.
- Node.js: a JavaScript runtime environment enabling Javascript outside of browser. 

- Bootstrap: open-source CSS framework
- VSCode: a source-code editor. 
- Figma: a web-based design tool for creating mockups and prototypes for interface design.

Troubleshooting: 

Per usual, had some technical issues with connecting to the client side. I feel like frontend does not like me but we're working on our relationship. I managed to eventually find a solution to the errors I would get running npm start, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/error-error-0308010c-digital-envelope-routines-unsupported-node-error-solved/. I had to run npm uninstall react-script, and reinstall it again using npm run react-script due to some vulnerabilities in my dependencies. This project is not near to my expectations of what I wanted to create but I am still proud that I didn't throw away the entire project I was able to create a MERN stack app with the resources I had available.

Development: 

Clone Repo

cd client 
run npm install
cd backend
run npm install 

I would like to build more on this as the idea of what I wanted to create had a steeper learning curve than I could manage in my current state. I spent majority of time reviewing to build, wireframing and trying to create a calendar using npm react-calendar.
